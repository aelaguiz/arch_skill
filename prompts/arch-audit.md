description: "08) Audit: code vs plan gaps list."
argument-hint: DOC_PATH=<path>
---
Execution rule: do not block on unrelated dirty files in git; ignore unrecognized changes. If committing, stage only files you touched (or as instructed).
Do not preface with a plan or restate these instructions. Begin work immediately. If a tool-call preamble is required by system policy, keep it to a single terse line with no step list. Console output must ONLY use the specified format; no extra narrative.
Compare the architecture doc at $DOC_PATH against the actual code in the current repo.
Find gaps, drift, missed call sites, and violations of conventions/patterns.
Update the doc with a **Gaps & Concerns List** using the exact format below.
Write the block into $DOC_PATH (append near the end, before Decision Log). Do not paste the full block to the console.

DOCUMENT INSERT FORMAT (append near the end, before Decision Log):
